# /configs
Here, we have hydra config files used to track our experiments.

Training configs include **ACID and RE10K** datasets (trained separately, matching the in-domain evaluation of MVSplat).
When we extend (TODO) using 3DCS, we would want to evaluate on **DTU, MipNerf360, Tanks & Temples, and DeepBlending** datasets and compare with the results of our re-implementation of MVSplat for 3DGS. Automatic reporting script will be available later.
